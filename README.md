In this project we do:

👍 Extract our OLTP in Postgres into out data warehouse (Also Postgres)

👍 Clean and transform the data for visualization purpose

👍 Visualize business metrics into Power BI and share

👍 Data refresh in Power BI UI every 30 MINUTES

Tools we use:
ETL: Apache Airflow
Clean and Transform: SQL, Python
Visualization : Power BI, Excel

Our achievements:
✍️ Business users now can take actions more frequency base on our metrics, and don't have to wait until the end of day

✍️ Business users can spend more time on sales, marketing instead of reporting, less manual work and more productivity

This is a On-Going Project so we need to modify more based on the users
